# Resume State

Updated: 2026-04-28

## Last Completed Slice

Milestone 2 Windows local collector foundation.

## Completed

- Added root `AGENTS.md` with mandatory installed skill usage and always-on
  todo/test/build/commit/push workflow.
- Added `total_todolist.md` as the full PRD checklist.
- Added common domain models: `Device`, `Platform`, `AppFamily`,
  `PlatformApp`, `FocusSession`, `WebSession`, `DeviceStateSession`,
  `DailySummary`.
- Added contract DTOs for device registration and focus/web/raw upload batches.
- Added `DomainNormalizer` and `DailySummaryCalculator`.
- Added app-family grouping support so platform app keys can roll up to a
  shared family label in daily top apps.
- Added explicit null guards for upload batch request item lists.
- Added Windows tracking project and tests.
- Added `FocusSessionizer` app-change, same-window, and idle-state behavior.
- Added pure `IdleDetector`.
- Added foreground window collector abstraction with fake-testable reader/clock.
- Added Windows `user32.dll` foreground window and last-input readers behind
  interfaces.
- Added `docs/contracts.md` for time/date, device, upload idempotency, and web
  domain policy.
- Verified `dotnet test Woong.MonitorStack.sln --no-restore -maxcpucount:1 -v minimal`.
- Verified `dotnet build Woong.MonitorStack.sln --no-restore -maxcpucount:1 -v minimal`.
- Pushed initial commit `fdf703c` to `origin/main`.

## Next Highest Priority

Continue Milestone 2 hardening:

1. Add a polling orchestration service that combines foreground snapshot,
   last-input idle status, and `FocusSessionizer`.
2. Add a safe manual smoke command or console harness for foreground logging on
   Windows 10.
3. Then move to Milestone 3 Windows SQLite + outbox.
